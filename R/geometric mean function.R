#' Calculate the geometric mean
#'
#' \code{gm_mean} takes as input a numeric vector and returns the geometric mean
#'
#' When there are no zeroes in a vector of numbers, then the geometric mean is
#' defined as the nth root of the product of all the values \emph{and is
#' equivalently defined as} exp(1/n * the sum of the logs of each value).
#' However, those two are not equivalent if there are zeroes!
#'
#' This function gives the option of propagating zeroes. If you want to get a 0
#' when the vector includes 0 values, that's the definition of the nth root of
#' the product of all values, so that would be zero.propagate = TRUE.
#'
#' Alternatively, if you want to just ignore 0 values, you can choose
#' zero.propagate = FALSE. Then, either definition works, and, since R has a
#' built-in sum(...) function but not a built-in product(...) function, you use
#' the definition where the geometric mean = exp(1/n * the sum of the logs of
#' each value) and that will give you an actual number if you ignore the zeroes.
#'
#' Note that the geometric mean is undefined for negative numbers.

#' Calculate the geometric standard deviation
#'
#' \code{gm_sd} takes as input a numeric vector and returns the geometric standard deviation
#'
#' Per Wikipedia's entry on the geometric standard deviation, the geometric
#' standard deviation is dimensionless. See that entry for the formula used.
#'
#' Also, note that the way you determine the range of the data
#' for the geometric mean +/- one geometric standard deviation is NOT
#' geometric mean value +/- the geometric standard deviation! Instead, it is
#' geometric mean / geometric standard deviation to geometric mean * geometric
#' standard deviation!
