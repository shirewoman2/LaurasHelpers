#' Save an Excel file with standard formatting for the header row
#'
#' This function saves a data.frame to an Excel file with the header row in bold
#' face, centered both horizontally and vertically, and with wrapped text. It
#' also sets the column widths to a reasonable guess based on the data you're
#' writing. For more details, please see \code{\link{formatXL}}.
#'
#' @param DF input data.frame
#' @param file file name (character)
#' @param sheet sheet name (character). Defaults to the name of the supplied
#'   data.frame if no other name is supplied.
#'
#' @return This does not return any R objects; instead, it saves an Excel file.
#' @examples
#' data(iris)
#'
#' formatXL_head(DF = iris, file = "test.xlsx", sheet = "iris1")
