#' Collapse a vector of character strings into one readable string, separated by
#' commas and by "and"
#'
#' \code{str_comma} combines multiple character strings into one and makes them
#' more readable by separating those strings with commas and "and" as
#' appropriate. The place I had in mind for using this is in RMarkdown documents
#' where you want to insert a comment in the text that calls on a character
#' vector. For example, say you want to note in a text chunk which subjects in a
#' study have some measurement that is two standard deviations above the mean.
#' Rather than using only, e.g., \code{stringr::str_c(StudyOutliers, collapse =
#' ", ")}, you could have it include the "and" in the appropriate location and
#' make your final document more polished, readable, and professional.
